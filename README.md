# Self-tuning Rank Selection In Multivariate Response Regression

This package implements a self-tuning procedure of selecting the rank of the regression coefficient matrix in multivariate response regression. The procedure can be used to select the low rank under a factor model. 

Example:  
 	Let Y and X be a n by m response matrix and a n by p feature design matrix. SRS(Y, X) returns the estimated rank of regressing Y on X.
      
Other specifications of SRS are documented in STRS.R
