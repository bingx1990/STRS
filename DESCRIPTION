Title: Self-tuning rank selection in multivariate regression
Description: An implementation of the Self-tuning Rank Selection procedure in R. 
    The procedure iteratively adapts the penalty term to the optimal signal-to-
    noise ratio in a fully data-driven way. The original setting is the multiv-
    ariate regression with reduced-rank coefficient matrix, but can be adapted 
    to the rank selection in factor model.
